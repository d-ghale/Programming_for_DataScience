    "## Combining files\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a total of 20 files broken down into 4 schools (`access_code`) and each of them have 5 groups of variables (`game_code`). Below is the list of `game_code` and variables we are interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** 3008: spawned position\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** 4002: foodShot, foodNeeded\n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** 4003: alienTypeAndColor, hitType, speed\n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** 4004: reactionTime, eyeReactionTime\n",
    "\n",
    "**5)** 4005: hit position\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to combine all of them into one we need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "###   1)  Combine different `access_code` files within `game_code`\n",
    "\n",
    "For each `game_code` we have to stack the five files (different `access_code`) vertically (all column names must match)\n",
    "            \n",
    "\n",
    "###   2) Combine different  `game_code`  files\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of rows across different `access_code` doesn't need to match because each `access_code` contains a different number of participants. However, to merge different `game_code` files side-by-side we expected the same number of rows from step (1). To perform the merge we tried to use some of the common keys (`\"userID\", \"sesID\", \"gameLevel\", \"alienID\"`) among different `game_code`  files. And found that `sesID` is not a unique id per game level played. It is created when the user launches the game platform while a `gsUserID` is created when the user further opens the game (game platform has multiple games)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assign `gameID`\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a list of keys we can depend on, so we spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to accurately merge the files. First of all the `logTimestamp` and `gameTime` were not consistent (more on that later). So we decided to create a unique id for every game level played by a user. A user may not complete the game level so to avoid further issues with merging we filtered those out by first assigning a new gameID everytime alienID is 1 then we matched those games with the expected number of alienID to filter out the rows if that game was not completed (`filter_incomplete_game()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This `gameID` cannot be used as a key to merge across different `game_code` because we have different numbers of rows in each `game_code` file and the order in which the `gameID` might not be consistent. This will only be used to get rid of rows that are incomplete `gameLevel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue with merging `game_code`  files\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a mismatched number of rows, which was an issue when merging the files into one side-by-side. There was no unique id every time a game was played, so we spent a lot of time trying to find out why the rows didn't match.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4003, 4004 and 4005 have the same number of rows (243k), but the other two are different (3002: 244k, 4002: 305k). Even the three access codes with the same number of rows didn't produce a complete match when joined. All of this was a surprise to us because we thought originally the full data is split into multiple tables for storing purposes. So, we looked deeper into the data to find out where the problem was and found that rows of `game_code` are independently created, which also explained why the `logTimestamp` was not consistent across `game_code`. `logTimestamp`is the timestamp of when the server received the file not not when the game was played. Moreover, there were cases where two records of an alienID were logged at two different times and they were not in the correct order of `logTimestamp`.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Issue (1)** This issue affected all `game_code` files.\n",
    " \n",
    "Because of inconsistency in the order of alien_id and timestamp we couldn't solely depend on `logTimestamp` . To solve this issue we keep the row with the first timestamp if every column except for the `logTimestamp` is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "    df_3008 = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(my_path, 'ATM1F18_ayce_3008.csv'))\n",
    "\n",
    "    filter_df = df_3008[(df_3008['accessCode'] == 'ATM1F18')\n",
    "            & (df_3008['userID']== 16948 )  \n",

    "           & (df_3008['gameLevel']== 'SpaceCakesLevel 3-1-0')]\n",
    "    filter_df.sort_values([\"userID\",\"logTimestamp\",\"alienID\"]).reset_index(drop =True)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we use `gameTime` instead?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not the timestamp of when the data was generated, rather the time that passed between when the game was opened/started in milliseconds.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    from datetime import datetime\n",
    "    timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(650313)\n",
    "    print(timestamp.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))\n",

    "\n",
    "    filter_df.sort_values([\"userID\",\"gameTime\",\"alienID\"]).reset_index(drop =True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `gameTime` is more consistent than `logTimestamp`, we will create new `logTimestamp` (`new_logTimestamp`) that starts with the  `logTimestamp` for the first `alienID` then calculates the other `logTimestamp` by taking the difference between two `gameTime`. But since the `logTimestamp` varies and we need to merge the files we will just do this at the end after merging the files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2 a) Issue with 4003, 4004 and 4005**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we thought ['userID', 'sesID', 'gameLevel', 'alienID'] was unique and could be used to combine those five `game_code`, but turns out the `sesID` is just an ID assigned every time a user logs into the app. Therefore, there were multiple gamelevels and even the same level game was played multiple times within a `sesID`. A slightly better id was `gsUserID`, which was an id assigned every time a user logs into the game (the app has multiple games). If a user plays the same or new level the `gsUserid` doesn't change. But, using `gsUserID` greatly reduced the unique ID problem. We decided to rename `gsUserID` if it is duplicated when grouped by \"userID\", \"gameLevel\" and \"alienID\", by sorting the data based on the `logTimestamp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2 b) Issue with 3008**\n",
    "It made sense that 3008 had more rows than the other groups because 3008 records the spawned positions of the aliens. Maybe the aliens spawned and were recorded in the database but the player never finished playing so other variables were not recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2 c) Issue with 4002**\n",
    "4002 had more rows than the rest because for complicated levels some aliens need both Food/Drink and we did not find any \"foodShot\" with \"Food/Drink\". The issue was that a row was created per button pressed so, when \"foodNeeded\" was \"Food/Drink\" we needed to combine two rows. Unfortunately the second row was not marked as \"Food/Drink\" so we have to depend on `logTimestamp` to merge those rows.\n",

    "#### 2 c.1) two rows when column \"foodNeeded\" == \"FOOD/DRINK\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 53122 out of 248377 rows with `foodNeeded` == \"FOOD/DRINK\". We needed to alter column `foodShot` == \"DRINK\" to \"FOOD/DRINK\" if corresponding column `foodNeeded` is \"FOOD/DRINK\" and in the next row, important to order based on selected keys, all column values except for `logTimestamp` and `gameTime` are the same and `foodShot` == \"FOOD\". So, we assign `dup_newID`, based on whether all of the column values (including `logTimestamp` and `gameTime`) expect for `foodShot` and `foodNeeded` matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce error we decided to split the dataframe depending on the techniques we needed to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Split the rows based on whether for that level we expect  \"foodNeeded\" == \"FOOD/DRINK\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Not expected levels:** 0 out of 86590 duplicate IDs so no cleaning needed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expected levels:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    If all \"foodNeeded\" == \"FOOD/DRINK\" had their corresponding rows and were identified by `dup_newID`, we expected at 53122*2 records but only found  42686 rows out of 161787 with duplicate ids. We found 21343 out 42686 rows of `foodNeeded` == \"FOOD/DRINK\" had corresponding rows of `foodShot` == \"FOOD\". For the rest of the rows (31779) either the `logTimestamp` and `gameTime` didn't match or didnt have it's corresponding rows at all (meaning the user only shot one type of food).\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - if duplicate ids then we merged the rows\n",
    "    - if not duplicate ids:\n",
    "        - some  \"foodNeeded\" == \"FOOD/DRINK\" rows where we expect two rows did not have them, so we had to be careful not to alter those\n",
    "        - other \"foodNeeded\" == \"FOOD/DRINK\" rows had corresponding rows, but did not have the same `gameTime` or `logTimestamp`. \n",
