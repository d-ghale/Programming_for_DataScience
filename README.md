## Programming_for_DataScience

**`Final_Group_Project`** contains the final group project I (Doma Ghale) did with my classmates (Joseph Stansil, Jing Zhang and Chinelo Ibekwe) for the 
Programming for Data Science class. We analyzed the game "All you can E.T., " which was an experiment conducted in the fall of 2018 by the NYU CREATE Lab.I do not have the proprietary rights to share the data. Therefore, I have only shared my code, our class presentation slides, and report. I worked on the initial stage of our project that was data cleaning, wrangling and preparation for the analysis. Some examples of my work are listed below:

- investigate and remove duplicate records
- remove incomplete games if the maximum alien id does not match the expected number of aliens at a specific game level
- calculate new timestamp based on the first timestamp of the game round and amount of time that had passed since the game started
- create unique ids to merge files based on knowledge of the game and format of the data
