# Programming_for_DataScience


This repository contains the final group project I (Doma Ghale) did with my classmates (Joseph Stansil, Jing Zhang and Chinelo Ibekwe) for the Programming for Data Science class. 

Data comes from an experiment conducted in the fall of 2018 by the NYU CREATE Lab. I do not have the proprietary rights to share the data nor my classmates' code. Therefore, I have only shared my code, our presentation slides and our report. My code demonstrate the bulk of work I did cleaning and merging the data to prepare it for analysis.
